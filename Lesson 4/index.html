                And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom.
                We cannot walk alone. And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back.
                There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, when will you be satisfied? 
                We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality.
                We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities.
